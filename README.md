# Anchour Test Instructions

We made this test to assess as much of your general and WordPress-specific coding skills as possible in the shortest amount of time possible. So hopefully this doesn't take up too much of your time!

## General tasks:

* Clone this repository to your computer
* Checkout the ```develop``` branch
* Get the project running locally via MAMP or whatever you're comfortable with
* Import all content from [this file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j9e4775njzujfny/backup.sql?dl=0) via phpMyAdmin or whatever you're comfortable with
* Make the **"test tasks"** changes detailed below
* Push your work to the remote ```develop``` branch intermittently
* Check your changes at ```{your first name}```-test.anchour.net
* Let us know whenever you're finished!

## Test tasks:

* Add button to one column layout via Advanced Custom Fields
* Make two column layout and project panels stack on mobile-sized screens
* Add background images to projects without using Advanced Custom Fields
* Add excerpt to existing projects without using Advanced Custom Fields
* **BONUS POINTS** for making excerpt only show up on hover
* **SUPER BONUS POINTS** for replacing the CSS with SASS (not necessary by any means)
